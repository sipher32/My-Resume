    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Northrop Grumman, Sr. Principal Software Engineer ---- Dec '23 - Present</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Serving as a Senior Engineer and as Product Owner for one of the software teams on the B-21 simulation
            project.</li>
        <li>Created architecture and design for the Virtual Maintenance Trainer (VMT) interface to the bomber’s rehosted
            Vehicle Management System (VMS) (C++, Python).</li>
        <li>Created automated, Software Requirement Specification (SRS), and unit tests for our simulation software,
            Trainer Simulation Bridge (TSB) and helped integrate into our CI/CD pipeline (Python).</li>
        <li>Research the Stores Management System (SMS) software and design/plan to integrate into the Simulation
            environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CAE USA / CAE MSI, Software Engineering Manager ---- Feb '21 - Nov '23</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Managed a team of 20+ software engineers across multiple projects. Drove technical recruiting across
engineering and R&D departments.</li>
        <li>Led the software development team to create a repository of geospatial data and have the available data viewable
on a 2D map for the U.S. Air Force. This repository can be searched via metadata parameters for content that
matches; the system provided capability to package and download data locally.</li>
        <li>Led four product teams composed of 30 software engineers, and served as Product owner for cloud team, to
improve NGA’s ability to deliver geo-specific, real-world 3D content to end users for analysis, planning and
decision-support by delivering eight different microservices to process, display, and interact with geospatial data.</li>
        <li>Directed 12 software developers and performed scrum master duties for USSOCOM prototype providing the
automation of rapid generation of 3D geospatial data</li>
        <li>Guided and motivated <a href="https://www.ippd.ufl.edu/blogs/ay2223team04/blog-posts/">UF student-based</a> research team comparing the performance of ECS within Unity and
Unreal Engine with the goal to satisfy a massive amount of entities (100k+) and much faster than real-time
(1000x) simulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CAE USA, Software Engineer 1-3 ---- Mar '13 - Feb '21</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Participated and led efforts on all projects for derived requirements, design of tactical software, implementing
and testing software for customer delivery.</li>
        <li>Led team of four engineers for the Weapons, Tactical Sensors, and Computer Generated Forces (CGF)
        development effort for $40 million tactical and operational flight trainers for an international attack helicopter
        program for the latter years. Additionally performed as scrum master for the project.</li>
        <li>Worked on Research and Development efforts (C++, WinForms, C#) for the engineering department which
        generated $10 million revenue from products developed.</li>
        <li>Performed radar simulation work (C++, DirectX, Ada, Fortran) on multiple projects.</li>
        <li>CGF work for many programs (XML, C++), including defining entity definitions for many models (XML),
            mediator and networking work for the host computer to access the entity and terrain server data (C++), this
            includes weapon damage tuning and critical mission scenario development. Designed and tuned smoothing
            algorithm to fix entity jittering on the display.</li>
        <li>Made modifications to CGF framework to support additional entity data, and add functionality to satisfy
requirements. Created GUIs (WPF) and object database (XML) so the user can create their own entity
definitions.</li>
        <li>Created Virtual Machine (VMWare) for CGF to remove the need to test with $20+ million hardware.</li>
        <li>Completed company library records application TAL - Technical Asset Library (Microsoft Access and SQL).
Implemented capability to add/update/delete records and advanced search feature.</li>
        <li>Created C++ wrapper interface to handle new weapons code for use by older host systems.</li>
        <li>Contributed towards design and production of interoperability software to allow integration of full flight
mission simulators into one simulated environment (Ada).</li>
        <li>Implemented interface for UDP ethernet packets supporting Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) standard.</li>
    </ul>
